XMLRPCToNSLog
=============

cmdline Obj-C tool that takes XML RPC and outputs it via NSLog for easier reading.

It could be better, taking the URL as an argument and loading the URL itself would be a start.

Example usage
-------------------------

    curl -s "http://www.xmlrpcmonthly.com/March" | ~/xmlrpcPipeToNSLog
